Purpose: This software was created as a client management system for a small business in Belize City, Belize. 

Details:
The application was created using Visual Basic 6.0 and MS Access.

This software was built during my first programming job for a software startup during the summer after my 2nd year of college. The code is poorly designed in terms of not using a central class for all database operations (known as the adapter design pattern), due to my fear of straying from the initial prototype given to me by a former employee of that company. As a budding programmer who didn't know anything about Visual Basic, I regrettably wrestled with the poorly designed code to build a functioning system.

After delivery, I initiated a complete rewrite of the application (with additional features) in the Visual Basic.NET language with a MySQL backend. I hadn't used VB.NET before, but I felt that it was better promoting object-oriented programming. The company could not fund the rewrite and the application was later scrapped.
