Curses Pong Clone

The supplied 2-player, Pong Clone implements the classic Pong gameplay. The first player to score 10 points wins the game.

The system should be built using the supplied makefile. The implementation consists of a number of objects used to implement all aspects of the gameplay (sprites, collision detection, and heads-up display message printing). The game's rendering should adapt to any terminal resolution.
