  o we will have a brief discussion session in our upcoming
    lecture about this assignment.

Question 1.
  Implement the closure operator: ask users to first input the
  names of the attributes, for simplicity upper case single
  characters will do, e.g., ABCD indicates a DB table with 4
  atributes A thru D. Next the users are asked to key in the
  set of FDs, such as A->C. All trivial FDs are ignored and
  those FDs not in non-trivial forms such as AB->CD are translated
  to standard non-trivial forms AB->C and AB->D. Repeated FDs
  are ignored. Within a loop the users can type any set of 
  attributes as the seed, your program outputs the closure of
  these seeds. Your program exit from the loop when the users type 
  in "quit". 

Question 2.
  Implement a parser: users are first asked to input the single upper
  case attribute names of all DB schemas. For each attribute the users
  should also identify its types, for simplicity only char and int
  are allowed. After inputting all schema definitions, the users can
  then write SQL statements such as 
     Select attribute name(s)
     from table
     where condition
  condition is a single boolean expression in the form such as
  A > 4 if attribute A in table is of type int or A=='M' if A is
  of type char. For simplicity only one table is allowed in the from
  clause, and one condition is permitted. Your program must check the
  correctness of the syntax, the existence of attribute name(s) in
  schema table, and the right format of condition. For incorrect
  SQL statement your program should identify where the error is.
