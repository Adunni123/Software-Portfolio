Purpose: The system explored 5 clustering algorithms about the MPEG7 CE Shape dataset.

Details:
The system was built using Matlab for a Ph.D. level course in Machine Learning at the CUNY Graduate Center.

The project was a branch from the code pertaining to my ongoing research project in shape indexing of digital media.

The algorithms explored were:
1. Kmeans with a user-defined K
2. Gaussian Mixture Models with Expectation Maximization
3. Parametric Morphological Segmentation
4. Watershed Segmentation
5. Parametric Morphological Segmentation with K-means Reconstruction.

Algorithms 3 and 5 were implemented from scratch using basic morphological operators by me, with algorithm 5 yielding the most realistic/non-artificial clustering results out of all of the explored solutions.
