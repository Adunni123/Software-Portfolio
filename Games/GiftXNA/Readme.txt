Purpose: GiftXNA was a PC-based, pong-clone, birthday gift created for my girlfriend's birthday.

Details: 
The playable game was built using C# and XNA.

The game mechanics are similar to pong. The player controls me, a hopeless romantic whose only goal is to deliver kisses to his beautiful damsel. Kisses are given by pressing the spacebar and I may be moved using the up and down arrow keys.
