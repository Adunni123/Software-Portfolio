Purpose: The projects in this directory are recreational game development projects.

Details:
I worked on these projects (in addition to other very incomplete ideas) throughout my undergraduate studies; indeed, not much time was spent on actual coursework those days! Game development is very difficult and large-scale which makes the field a passion of mine; the projects have taught me more about OOD, algorithms, and data-structures than any toy, class project.

Each project contains its own readme for further details.
