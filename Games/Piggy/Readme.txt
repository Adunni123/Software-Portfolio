Purpose: Project Piggy was originally a 3D barnyard-based casual game built for the PC, and later rebuilt as a Flash/Actionscript prototype.

Details:
The original game prototype was built using C++ and the Irrlicht Rendering Engine. The game was being prototyped, but eventually scrapped due to a loss of interest. Towards the closing of the development period, I rewrote the project as a Flash title in Actionscript to not only play around with that technology, but to observe how much more quickly a prototype could be built in actionscript. Indeed, the original C++ game took a month or so to mock up, while the Actionscript version took 2-3 days.

The gameplay was a spinning-plate paradigm based around the casual game Diner Dash created by GameLab. The player would control a farmer who wanted to sell off the animal produce to customers that would drive by the barn looking for particular produce. 

The animals planned for the game included: pigs, cows, and chickens. Pigs would produce bacon and ham, at the expense of their health but yield high profits. Chickens would yield eggs which were low in profit, but not harmful to the welfare of the chicken. Chickens would also yield chicken-breast, at the expense of their health. Cows would yield milk (non-lethal but low-profit) and hamburger meat (lethal but high-profit). 

The farmer would have to meet a certain profit margin or risk being shut down. Of course, meeting the profit margin meant possibly sacrificing the well-being of some of the animals. In addition, the animals also required basic care: feeding, affection, and cleaning.
