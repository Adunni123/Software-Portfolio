Created: Spring, 2009
Purpose: ToyBox was a PC-based, 3D, first-person map editor meant to simulate the Halo 3 Forge editor.

Details:
The project was built using C++ and the Irrlicht Rendering Engine.

The gameplay was meant to allow for a map editor to customize first-person shooter maps. Users could enter one of two modes: edit or play. In edit mode, the player was allowed to explore a loaded map without gravity restrictions, loading and placing objects in any location of the world. The user would then be able to save the map and load for later playability. 

There was no actual gameplay in mind for this project, but I wanted to explore creating a usable tool using a game engine and its effect on the architecture of the system.

The project was later discarded because I got the maximum utility of the project and had no interest in finishing the product.
