Purpose: Webs was a Flash-based, 2D shoot 'em up remake of a C++ game that I briefly worked on at the Gamma Prime Studios startup.

Details: 
The game was built using Flash/Actionscript. It mainly served as another exploration of the Actionscript language and a test of how long it would take to prototype ideas. 

After numerous game ideas in C++, I really wanted to explore technologies that allowed for faster prototyping. This pursuit eventually led me to C# and XNA based game projects.
