Purpose: Project Gesture was a prototype of a 2D, Airplane Shoot 'Em Up based on gesture recognition, built for Windows and was eventually to be built for the Xbox 360.
Notes: The game's resources/artwork were only used as a mockup and were not planned for inclusion for the final product since they belonged to someone else.

Details:
The game prototype was built using C#, Microsoft XNA, MS Visual Studio 2008, and subversion.

The gameplay was an exploration in using joystick-based gesture recognition (shape drawing) to change the formation of a fleet of user-controlled airships. The game was meant for two players who could coordinate their gestures to trigger "fusion gestures" that would basically eradicate the enemies at hand. However, enemies would have damage affinities for certain shapes -- so players had to be wise as to which fusion gesture to trigger. 

The concept was iterated on and a decision was made that the Xbox 360 joysticks were too restrictive for intuitive shape drawing. The game was then designed for button combinations -- integrating a classic shoot 'em up with fighting-game button combinations. 

This was my first endeavor in XNA and was a great learning experience in building a game engine; albeit not at the level of using DirectX. The engine involved particle systems, gesture recognition components, and a collection of reusable components for use in future projects. My role in the development team was lead designer and programmer.
