Purpose: The Find a Fountain Android app will expose users to the closest NYC public drinking fountain locations. The app is being designed for use beyond NYC, but that is the initial audience due to fountain location availability.

Details:
The development of the app is ongoing using Eclipse, Android SDK, CakePHP, and a MySQL server backend.

The fountain data is located in a custom RESTful server backend built using the CakePHP framework. The server allows for GET and POST requests to obtain fountain locations in JSON format and also submit new fountain location, in addition to allowing users the ability to revise fountain information being captured in the application.

The release date for the app is still TBD, as this is my first Android project, but it will be a free application.
