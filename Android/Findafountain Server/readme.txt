Created: Summer 2011
Purpose: Restful server for the Android, client application Find a Fountain.

This server was created using the CakePHP framework. The server responds only to GET requests and serves both XML and JSON representations of the currently stored fountain locations in the backend, MySQL database.

Note: Database credentials have been removed for privacy. However, the rest of the source is the same as what's running on www.mrjoelkemp.com/findafountain and being used by the Android application.
